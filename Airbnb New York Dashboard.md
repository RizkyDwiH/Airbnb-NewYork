# Airbnb New York Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard visualizing Airbnb listing data across New York City's five boroughs. As a data analyst, the goal of this dashboard is to uncover key business insights and guide strategic decision-making for Airbnb's market optimization and expansion efforts in NYC.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard focuses on four main visualizations: - Room Type Distribution - Average Price by Borough - Listings by Neighbourhood Group - Average Availability per Borough

Each component reveals valuable insights to support Airbnb’s strategic planning and potential market interventions.

## Key Insights & Business Strategies

### 1. Room Type Distribution

**Insight:**\
The NYC Airbnb market is dominated by two room types:\
- **Entire home/apt** (19,435 listings)\
- **Private room** (16,346 listings)\
While **Hotel room** (335) and **Shared room** (206) listings are extremely limited.

**Business Implication:**\
This suggests the platform is mostly used by property owners and casual hosts, not commercial operators. It reflects a preference among travelers for privacy and independent stays.

**Strategy Suggestion:**\
- Promote **Hotel room** and **Shared room** categories to appeal to budget-conscious travelers or backpackers. - Develop campaigns highlighting the **value and authenticity** of private rooms. - Collaborate with boutique hotels in underserved areas to increase Hotel-type listings.

### 2. Average Price by Borough

**Insight:**\
- **Manhattan** has the highest average price at **\$92,608**, significantly higher than other boroughs. - Outer boroughs like **Queens (\$13,664)**, **Bronx (\$12,610)**, and **Staten Island (\$12,488)** have far more affordable listings.

**Business Implication:**\
Manhattan’s high prices reflect strong demand (especially from tourists and business travelers), while outer boroughs may be more attractive for long-term or budget travelers.

**Strategy Suggestion:**\
- Leverage **dynamic pricing tools** to optimize host earnings in high-demand areas. - Position listings in **Queens and Bronx** as affordable, longer-term alternatives for digital nomads or remote workers. - Highlight hidden gems and attractions in outer boroughs to balance demand distribution.

### 3. Listings by Neighbourhood Group

**Insight:**\
- **Manhattan (16,081)** and **Brooklyn (13,329)** dominate the platform’s supply. - **Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island** have significantly fewer listings.

**Business Implication:**\
Airbnb’s supply is heavily concentrated, which may lead to saturation, regulation risk, and missed opportunities in less tapped regions.

**Strategy Suggestion:**\
- Launch **host onboarding initiatives** in underrepresented boroughs. - Implement **community ambassador programs** to educate and empower local hosts. - Diversify the supply base to ensure sustainable growth across all boroughs.

### 4. Average Availability per Borough

**Insight:**\
- **Staten Island (234 days)** and **Bronx (209 days)** show the highest average availability. - **Brooklyn (148 days)** and **Manhattan (157 days)** show the lowest.

**Business Implication:**\
High availability may signal low demand or less popular listings, while low availability may suggest high booking rates or limited calendar openings.

**Strategy Suggestion:**\
- For **high-availability areas**: run **geo-targeted promotions**, offer **seasonal discounts**, and highlight **local experiences**. - For **low-availability areas**: improve **host tools** for scheduling and revenue management, helping maximize occupancy and earnings.

## Conclusion

This dashboard enables Airbnb to: - Understand supply/demand distribution across NYC - Identify pricing disparities - Detect underutilized regions and opportunities for expansion - Tailor regional strategies to improve host engagement and guest satisfaction
